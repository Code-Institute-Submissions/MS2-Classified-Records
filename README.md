## Design

The main colours used are as follows

These align with the look of the bricks and mortar store.

### Fonts
The font used throughout the site is Exo 2 from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Logos
- I designed the "CR" mini logo and favicon using [Free Logo Design](https://www.freelogodesign.org).
- The main Classified Records logos were generated using [Tailor Brands](https://www.tailorbrands.com).
- The Discogs logo is property of [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/).

### Wireframes

- I created site mockups using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for wireframes. The focus of this exercise was on defining the layout and structure of the site. Importantly, consideration was given to responsive design, with a mobile first philosphy employed. Identifying how the site layout should change at different screen sizes was an integral part of the wireframe process.
