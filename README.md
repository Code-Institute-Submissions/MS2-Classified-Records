Classified Records is an independent record store based in Dundalk, Ireland.

# UX

The aim of this project is to build a website which enables a small independent business to better engage with it's audience in order to drive the growth of the business.

- As a site owner I want the website to drive **customer engagement**
- As a site owner I want the website to drive **sales growth**

## The 5 Planes Considerations

### Strategy
The main goals for the store when deciding to undertake this project were to increase engagement with new and existing customers and to increase sales growth via an increased online presence.
The target audience is a broad demographic of audiophiles with various musical and cultural interests. With this in mind I set out to create an uncluttered, clean website that is easy and fun to interact with for all.

### Scope
The key interactive features on the website which users can engage with are:  
- Quiz - multiple choice questions which are a bit of fun to test users music knowledge  
- Contact form to submit any queries 
- Google Maps API

Other important features that I decided to include were easily accessible links to the store's Discogs marketplace page and social links, info on new records in stock and info on a weekly offer that users can avail of.

### Structure



## Design

### Colours
The main colours used are as follows

- ![#fc6161](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fc6161/000000?text=+) `#fc6161`
- ![#fafafa](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fafafa/000000?text=+) `#fafafa`
- Black
- White

These align with the look of the bricks and mortar store.

### Fonts
The font used throughout the site is Exo 2 from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Logos
- I designed the "CR" mini logo and favicon using [Free Logo Design](https://www.freelogodesign.org).
- The main Classified Records logos were generated using [Tailor Brands](https://www.tailorbrands.com).
- The Discogs logo is property of [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/).

### Wireframes

- I created site mockups using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for wireframes. The focus of this exercise was on defining the layout and structure of the site. Importantly, consideration was given to responsive design, with a mobile first philosphy employed. Identifying how the site layout should change at different screen sizes was an integral part of the wireframe process.
